# Project 1: Fake news prediction
## DESCRIPTION
This project converts a train.csv file provided by Kaggles fake news competition into a pandas dataframe, and trains a logistic regression
              model from sklearn.linearmodel to predict whether the news articles in the data set are real or fake based on the author and title of the 
              article. Accuracy is determined by comparing the models predictions to a 'label' column, from the data set, that identifies real (1) and fake 
              (0) news. An accuracy score is given using accuracy_score from the sklearn.metrics module. A simple predictive system that is able to 
              predict the validity of any given article from the dataset is also created.
